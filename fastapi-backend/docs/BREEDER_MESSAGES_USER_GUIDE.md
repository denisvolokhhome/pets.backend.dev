## Getting Started

### Accessing Your Messages

There are two ways to access your messages:

1. **Notification Icon**: Click the bell icon in the top-right corner of the navigation bar

### First Time Setup

No setup is required! The messaging system is automatically enabled for all breeders. You'll start receiving messages as soon as potential customers contact you through your profile.

## Notification Icon

### Understanding the Badge

The notification icon displays a red badge with the number of unread messages:

- **Number (1-99)**: Shows exact count of unread messages
- **99+**: You have 99 or more unread messages

### Auto-Refresh

The notification count automatically updates every 30 seconds, so you'll always see the latest count without refreshing the page.

Click the notification icon to instantly navigate to your messages list.
